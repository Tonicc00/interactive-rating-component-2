This was a bit more difficult challenge than I expected.
The biggest challenge was to figure out or, to find out how to allow only one button to change background color when clicked.

I found out something new with this project while I was looking up for a previously mentioned solution, and that is the posibility to select all the buttons with query selecting the div they are all in. Pretty neat.

Another thing I learned is hoe to make your div centered no matter the screen size. Usualy I was checking was it centered with different screen sizes and aligning it accordingly but it turns out you could do that with width and margin properties in css.

Anyways, I am glad I learned few new things and I hope to continue to do it in the furture. I think I will use these new things I learned here more often. Cheers!
